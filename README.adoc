This repository contains aports that are not merged in the official https://alpinelinux.org[Alpine Linux] repository yet or don’t adhere to Alpine polices (e.g. bundles).
Packages are automatically built on https://github.com/{gh-name}/actions[GitHub Actions] for x86_64 architecture and synchronized with a remote server using SSHFS (SSH Filesystem).

The *master branch* targets Alpine Linux *{repo-branch}*.
Aports for older Alpine https://alpinelinux.org/releases/[release branches] are in the same named branches in this repository, e.g. v3.15.
Alpine Edge (aka unstable, development branch) is not supported.


== Repositories

All the repositories are also available over link:rsync://repo.jirutka.cz/alpine/[].


=== Backports

* {repos-uri}/{repo-branch}/backports

Aports from the official Alpine repositories backported from edge to {repo-branch}.


=== User

* {repos-uri}/{repo-branch}/user

My aports that are not available in the official Alpine repository.

Some aports in this repository are “bundles” – an aport with (some) bundled dependencies.
It’s something that Alpine devs really don’t like, but it’s very convenient footnote:[Creating and maintaining gazillion distro-specific packages for Python modules, Rubygems, …, installing them globally and resolving version conflicts is nothing but totally insane…] for packaging applications with _a lot_ dependencies that are already managed by some language-specific package manager (e.g. pip, bundler, …).
All bundles are installed in `/usr/lib/bundles/<pkgname>`.


== How to use

. Add security key of this repository to your `/etc/apk/keys`:
+
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
cd /etc/apk/keys
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{gh-name}/{gh-branch}/.keys/{key-file}
----

. Add repositories that you want to use (see above) to `/etc/apk/repositories`.


== Git Hooks

You can find some useful git hooks in the `.githooks` directory.
To use them, run the following command after cloning this repository:

[source, sh]
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks


== How to setup your own repository
:remote-user: ci
:remote-host: alpine.example.org
:remote-dir: /var/www/alpine

This guide will help you to set up your own aports repository and infrastructure for building packages using CI.
It targets GitHub and GitHub Actions, but it might be modified for any other git hosting and CI.
However, if you want to build packages on your own CI server, then this approach might be unnecessarily complicated.

.*You will need:*
* Account on GitHub.
* Some server with SSH access for serving static files via HTTP(S) (e.g. using nginx), with enough disk space for binary packages.

.*We will use the following variables:*
* Domain name of your server: `{remote-host}` _(replace with your own domain)_
* Name of the user on your server for deploying abuilds: `{remote-user}` _(you may choose different user)_
* Path of directory on your server for deploying abuilds: `{remote-dir}` _(you may choose different directory)_


=== Set up server

. Create user `{remote-user}`:
+
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
useradd --no-create-home --shell=/bin/sh --gid www-data {remote-user}

# or if you don' have useradd
adduser -h {remote-dir} -s /bin/sh -G www-data -D -H {remote-user}
sed -i- 's/^{remote-user}:!:/{remote-user}:*:/' /etc/shadow
----

. Prepare directories:
+
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
install -d -m 0755 -o root -g root {remote-dir}
cd {remote-dir}

install -d -m 0755 -o {remote-user} -g root packages
install -d -m 0700 -o {remote-user} -g root .secret ~/.ssh
----

. Jail user `{remote-user}` to `{remote-dir}` and restrict him to use sftp only; add the following lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
+
[source, conf, subs="attributes"]
----
Match User {remote-user}
    ChrootDirectory {remote-dir}
    ForceCommand internal-sftp
    X11Forwarding no
    AllowTcpForwarding no
----

. Set up web server to serve `{remote-dir}/packages` on http://{remote-host}/packages. Ensure that `{remote-dir}/.secret/` is *not* accessible from web! Example configuration for nginx:
+
[source, nginx, subs="attributes"]
----
server {
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name {remote-host};
    root {remote-dir};

    location /.security {
        deny all;
    }

    location / {
        autoindex on;
    }
}
----

=== Set up repository

. Create repository for your aports on GitHub. Let’s assume that it’s named `{repo-name}`.

. Clone branch `template` of this repository, change remote to your own repository and create branch `master`:
+
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
git clone --branch template https://github.com/{gh-name}.git {repo-name}
cd {repo-name}
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/{repo-name}.git
git checkout -b master
----

. Generate SSH deploy key:
+
[source]
----
mkdir -p .keys
ssh-keygen -C '' -t ed25519 -N '' -f .keys/deploy-key
----

. Go to *Settings > Secret* in your repository on GitHub and add new secrets:
** `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` – paste output of `ssh-keyscan {remote-host}`
** `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` – paste content of `.keys/deploy-key`
** `SSH_REMOTE` – `{remote-user}@{remote-host}:/`

. Copy `.keys/deploy-key.pub` to file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` in home directory of user `{remote-user}` on your server. This file *must* be owned by `{remote-user}` and has mode 0600!

. Generate a security key for signing packages:
+
[source]
----
KEY_NAME="$(git config --get user.email)-$(printf "%x" $(date +%s)).rsa"
openssl genrsa -out ".keys/$KEY_NAME" 2048
openssl rsa -in ".keys/$KEY_NAME" -pubout -out ".keys/$KEY_NAME.pub"
----

. Copy `$KEY_NAME` to file `{remote-dir}/.secret/$KEY_NAME` on the server, set owner `{remote-user}` and mode `0400`.

. Delete generated private keys:
+
[source]
----
rm .keys/deploy-key ".keys/$KEY_NAME"
----

. Adjust `BRANCH`, `BUILD_REPOS` and repositories (step “Configure repositories”) in link:.github/workflows/ci.yml[].

. Change variables `:repo-name:`, `:repo-branch:`, `:gh-name:`, `:repos-uri:`, and `:key-file:` on the top of file link:README.adoc[].

. Commit changes and push to GitHub.

Now create directories for your repositories (e.g. user, backports, …) and add your aports.
